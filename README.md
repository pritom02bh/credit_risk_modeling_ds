### Project Introduction:


In this project, we will build three models.

  1. **Probability of Default Model:** Probability of a customer not repaying their debt. (Logistic Regression)
  2. **Loss Given Default Model:** The proportion of exposure the company loses when a customer defaults. (Linear Regression)
  3. **Exposure of Default Model:** The bank is exposed to a total loss in terms of money if a customer defaults. (Linear Regression)

Utilizing these three models, I aim to compute the overall expected loss (E.L.) for the entire array of loans within the bank's portfolio. Additionally, the final segment delves into the aspects of model maintenance and its deployment for professional applications in the banking domain.

While the real world presents improbable scenarios, such as lenders grappling with unforeseen or extraordinary losses amid severe economic downturns, my project primarily addresses anticipated losses. Specifically, the project concentrates on the expected loss linked to credit risk.
