### Project Introduction:
In this project, we will build three models.

      1. Probability of Default Model (probability of a customer not repaying their debt.)
      2. Loss Given Default Model (Proportion of exposure the company loses when a customer defaults)
      3. Exposure of Default Model (Total loss the bank is exposed to in terms of money if a customer defaults)

With these three models, we will calculate the total expected loss (E.L.) for the complete portfolio of loans that the bank holds.  
And the end part is about maintaining the model and deploying it for professional banking use.
