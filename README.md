### Project Introduction:
In this project, we will build three models.

      1. Probability of Default Model
      2. Loss Given Default Model
      3. Exposure of Default Model

With these three models, we will calculate the total expected loss (E.L.) for the complete portfolio of loans that the bank holds.
