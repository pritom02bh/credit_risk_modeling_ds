### Project Introduction:
In this project, we will build three models.

      1. Probability of Default Model 
Probability of a customer not repaying their debt. (Logistic Regression)
      
      2. Loss Given Default Model 
The proportion of exposure the company loses when a customer defaults. (Linear Regression)
      
      3. Exposure of Default Model 
The bank is exposed to total loss in terms of money if a customer defaults. (Linear Regression)

With these three models, we will calculate the total expected loss (E.L.) for the complete portfolio of loans that the bank holds.  
And the end part is about maintaining the model and deploying it for professional banking use.
